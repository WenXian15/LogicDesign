Fundamental Concept
*******************
1. Differential Signal
2. System-Synchronous, Source-Synchronous, and Self-Synchronous

3. Clock/Data Recovery


Line Encoding Schemes
*********************
Objective:
1. Provide a means of aligning the data into words with a good DC balance on Line.
2. Provide for implementation of clock correction, block synchronization and channel bonding.
3. Two main line encoding schemes: Value lookup schemes (8/10b) and self-modifying streams/scramblers
4. Comma Detection - Comma/COM are unique symbols (K-Characters).  Comma is inserted as a checkpoint.  Protocol will agree on using certain K-Characters as COM

Ordered Sequences such as TS1 and TS2 use COM at the beginning of the sequence.

1. Equalization is an attempt to compensate for differences in impedance/losses relative to frequency.
